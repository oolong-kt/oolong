    // MARK: Common Array Usage
    /**
     This method defaults many of the boilerplate callbacks needed to populate a
     UIPickerView when using an `Array` as a data source.
     The defaults that this method takes care of:
     
     * Provides the number of components
     * Provides the number of rows
     * Handles the pickerView(_:didSelectRow:inComponent:) delegate method
     * Provides the title string for each row
     
     This method simply sets basic default behavior. This means that you can
     override the default picker view handlers after this method is called.
     However, remember that order matters. If you call this method after you
     override the `numberOfComponents` callback, for instance, the closure
     you passed into `numberOfComponents` will be wiped out by this method
     and you will have to override that closure handler again.
     
     * Important:
     Please remember that Swift `Array`s are value types. This means that they
     are copied when mutaded. When the values or sequence of your array changes, you will
     need to call this method again, just before you call reloadComponent()
     or reloadAllComponents(). If you have a lot of picker view customization
     in addtion to a lot of updates to your array, it is more appropriate to use the individual
     closure handlers instead of this method.
     
     * * * *
     #### An example of calling this method:
     ```swift
     pickerView.addStrings(<#myArray#>) { aTitle,component,row in
         print("\(aTitle) was selected")
     }
     ```
     * parameter strings: An `Array` of `String`s to be used for each row in a single component picker view.
     * parameter didSelect: A closure that is called when the UIPickerView's value has been selected.
     
     * returns: itself so you can daisy chain the other delegate/datasource calls
