# Oolong/Superfine â€¢ [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com)

Oolong is an [Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture) inspired Model-View-Update (MVU) implementation for Kotiln multiplatform. As the name implies, three core concepts comprise the foundation of this architecture: 

* **Model** - a type to represent the program state

* **Update** - a function to update the state

* **View** - a function to map the state to view properties

By applying this simple pattern you can create composable, testable programs that can run on any platform. Oolong enables a common codebase for all platforms by using a `Render` function which is implemented by each frontend.

Get started with Oolong by reading the [official guide](../../../docs/guide/index.md).
